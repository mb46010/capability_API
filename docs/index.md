# HR AI Platform Governance

Welcome to the central governance portal for the HR AI Platform. This portal provides a comprehensive view of our capability inventory, security policies, and compliance status.

## Quick Links

- [Capability Catalog](/catalog): Browse all available Actions and Flows.
- [Policy Verification Dashboard](policy-verification/latest.md): View real-time security test results.
- [Architecture Overview](architecture.md): Understand the system design and security model.
- [Onboarding Guide](onboarding.md): How to get started as a developer or consumer.

## Core Initiatives

### 1. Capability Catalog
The [Capability Catalog](/catalog) transforms our internal registry definitions into browsable entities. It allows you to:
- Check data **sensitivity** levels (Low, Medium, High, Critical).
- Identify which actions require **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**.
- See exactly which **Policies** govern each action.
- Visualize complex **Orchestration Flows** using Mermaid diagrams.

### 2. Policy Verification
Our [Policy Verification Dashboard](policy-verification/latest.md) ensures that our access controls are always functioning as expected. It runs 100+ automated scenarios on every change to:
- Prevent unauthorized access.
- Validate wildcard policy matches.
- Ensure time-based and context-based restrictions are enforced.

### 3. Developer Resources
- [API Usage Guide](api_usage.md)
- [Security Architecture](security_architecture.md)
- [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md)
